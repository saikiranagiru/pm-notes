# Project Life Cycle
* What work will be performed in each phase
* What deliverables will be produced and when
* Who is involved in each phase, and 
* How management will control and approve work produced in each phase

## In early phases of a project life cycle
* Resource needs are usually lowest
* The level of uncertainty (risk) is highest
* Project stakeholders have the greatest opportunity to influence the project
## In middle phases of a project life cycle
* The certainty of completing a project improves
* More resources are needed
## The final phase of a project life cycle focuses on
* Ensuring that project requirements were met
* The sponsor approves completion of the project
